### [Homework](https://github.com/justyzas/25-05-28-GEN-AI/blob/main/homework/2025-05-29.MD)

## 📅 **Day 3**

- Questions and Recap of Day 2
- Python operations with strings, numbers, introduction to lists

- Discussing about GEN AI models
- Gen AI models limitations

#### 🔮 1. **Hallucination (Making Things Up)**

- Gen AI models may **generate content that sounds plausible but is completely false**.
- This includes:
  - Incorrect facts
  - Fake references
  - Made-up URLs or studies
- ⚠️ Critical in fields like medicine, law, or academia.

#### 📅 2. **Lack of Real-Time or Recent Knowledge**

- Most models are trained on **static data** with a **knowledge cutoff** (e.g., GPT-4 is trained up to late 2023).
- They **do not access the internet** by default.
- This makes them **unreliable for breaking news, live events, or up-to-date info**.

---

#### 🧠 3. **No True Understanding or Reasoning**

- LLMs **do not think or understand** like humans.
- They generate text based on **patterns and probabilities**, not logic or comprehension.
- They may fail at:
  - Multi-step logical problems
  - Understanding ambiguous input
  - Reasoning about cause and effect

---

#### 🧾 4. **Memory and Context Limitations**

- Models have a **maximum context length** (e.g., 4k, 8k, 128k tokens).
- If you input too much text, earlier content may be **truncated or forgotten**.
- They do **not persist memory** between sessions unless designed with tools like memory APIs or databases.

#### 🌍 5. **Bias and Toxicity**

- Models are trained on **internet-scale data**, which includes **biases, stereotypes, and harmful language**.
- They may:
  - Reflect societal biases
  - Reinforce stereotypes
  - Generate offensive or inappropriate output if not carefully prompted or filtered

### 6. It may fail on very simple and specific tasks, for example, counting 'r's in word "strawberry"

### 7. It may fail in image generation while trying to add some text. Characters may seem distorted.

### 8. Hosting LLM may seem very expensive in resources

## 🤖 **AI Model Types**

---

### 🧠 1. **Vision LLMs**

#### 🔍 What They Do:

- Process and understand **images or visual input**.
- Combine **language + vision** to answer questions about pictures, describe images, or interact **multimodally**.

#### 📌 Typical Tasks:

- **Image captioning**: “Describe this image.”
- **Visual question answering**: “What’s the man holding in the picture?”
- **Multimodal interaction**: “Read the text in this screenshot and explain it.”

#### 🧪 Examples in Ollama:

- `llava`, `bakllava`, `gpt-4o` (if supported), `blip`, `clip`

#### ⚙️ How They Differ:

- Expect an **image as input**, alongside or instead of text.
- Cannot be used meaningfully for **language-only tasks** like embeddings.

---

### 🛠️ 2. **Tools LLMs**

#### 🔍 What They Do:

LLMs configured to work with **external tools**, like:

- Calculators
- Web search
- Code execution
- APIs

#### 📌 Typical Tasks:

- “What’s 1249123 divided by 7.3?” → Calls a **calculator tool**
- “Get the current weather in Berlin” → Calls a **weather API**
- **Agent workflows** (multi-step reasoning)

#### 🧪 Examples in Ollama:

- Tool-using variants of LLMs integrated with:
  - **LangChain**
  - **AutoGPT-like flows**
  - **Function-calling models**

#### ⚙️ How They Differ:

- They don’t “know” the answers — they **perform actions or call helpers**.
- May rely on **additional code or environment**.

  - Ollama **doesn’t handle tool execution** natively — it **serves the LLM**; the toolchain is external.

  ***

### 🧠 3. **Language LLMs (Text-only Models)**

#### 🔍 What They Do:

These are the most common LLMs — trained to **understand and generate human-like language**.

#### 📌 Typical Tasks:

- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Code generation and debugging
- Summarization, translation, rewriting
- Creative writing or brainstorming

#### 🧪 Examples in Ollama:

- `llama3`, `mistral`, `gemma`, `phi`, `tinyllama`

#### ⚙️ How They Differ:

- Work only with **text input and output**.
- Great for general-purpose use, but **not multimodal** (can’t process images).
- Often the most optimized and resource-efficient models in Ollama.

---

### 🧩 4. **Embedding Models**

#### 🔍 What They Do:

These models **convert text into vectors (embeddings)** — numerical representations that capture semantic meaning.

#### 📌 Typical Tasks:

- Semantic search (e.g., “find documents similar to this query”)
- Clustering similar texts
- Vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS)
- Text classification and similarity scoring

#### 🧪 Examples in Ollama:

- Embedding variants of `mistral`, `bge`, or smaller transformer-based models

#### ⚙️ How They Differ:

- They don’t generate language like a chatbot.
- Their job is **representational** — not conversational.
- Output is a **vector of numbers**, not words or sentences.

---

- **Ollama model installation** and **running** on **local machine**

## 📅 **Day 4: Lists, Loops & Prompt Engineering**

---

### 🔁 **Topics Covered**

- ✅ Recap of Day 3
- 📝 Review of Homework
- 📋 Working with **Lists**:
  - Creating and accessing elements
  - Slicing syntax (`list[start:stop:step]`)
  - Common methods: `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.sort()`, etc.
- 🐞 **Python Debugging**:
  - Using `print()` statements
  - Using breakpoints in VS Code
- 🔁 **Loops**:
  - `for` and `while` loops
  - Looping through lists and ranges
  - `break`

---

### 🧠 **Key Terms & Concepts**

- **Token**  
  The smallest unit into which text data can be broken down for an AI model to process.

- 💰 **Token Cost Tip**  
  _Input is often cheaper than output_ — models charge less to receive a prompt than to generate a response.

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  A skill and practice for designing, refining, and optimizing **prompts** to effectively guide large language models (LLMs) in performing tasks or answering questions.  
  Useful for:

  - Improving accuracy
  - Reducing hallucinations
  - Enhancing creative output

- **API Key**  
  A **secret identifier** used to authenticate with an external API service (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).  
  ⚠️ **CAUTION:** Never share your API key publicly — it can be misused and expose you to unwanted costs.

This file documents the evolution of our vector database learning examples using ChromaDB, OpenAI embeddings, and semantic search.

---

## 📅 **Day 10: Intro to Vector Databases. Persisting Embeddings Along with Text**

**Why Vector Databases?**

- Enable fast, accurate **semantic search**
- Support retrieval by:
  - Embeddings
  - Raw text
  - Metadata filters
- Allow **fuzzy matching**: retrieve relevant results even if query wording differs
- Support **long-term storage of embeddings**, saving on LLM API costs
- Fast, scalable, and compact storage for high-dimensional vectors

**What We Did:**

- Introduced ChromaDB (in-memory and file-persistent modes)
- Used `.upsert()` to add data without duplication
- Inserted user-entered documents into a persistent vector DB
- Queried those documents semantically using `query_texts` and `query_embeddings`
- Discussed that **each collection should use one consistent embedding model**
- Observed the importance of **embedding dimension consistency**

---

## ✅ Phase 1: In-Memory ChromaDB Demo

**File:** `/chroma_demo.py`

- Created an in-RAM vector database using `chromadb.Client()`
- Inserted two simple documents manually (`pineapple`, `oranges`)
- Used `query_texts` to semantically search for a relevant document
- Introduced `get_or_create_collection` to avoid duplicate collections
- Switched from `add()` to `upsert()` to prevent duplicate document insertions

**Concepts learned:**

- How to use vector DB for semantic similarity
- Memory vs persistent storage
- Embedding done by Chroma internally (default model)

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Persistent Vector Storage + Manual Input

**Files:**

- `/chroma_insert.py`
- `/chroma_search.py`

**Changes:**

- Used `chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./vector-db")` to store data across runs
- Took user input and added it to a "driving_rules" collection
- Enabled search via user query
- Collection persists between runs, allowing accumulation of rules

**Concepts learned:**

- Vector storage across sessions
- Basic document I/O via CLI
- Collection count and dynamic ID generation

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Embedding with OpenAI

**Folder:** `/with_llm/`

**Files:**

- `embed.py`:
  - Added support for embedding via OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small` model (on Azure)
  - Created `get_embedding()` and `get_embeddings()` for single/batch use
- `insertion.py`:
  - Embedded user input manually
  - Added to collection with metadata (e.g., `source: "KET Lietuva 2025"`)
- `search.py`:
  - Embedded user query with OpenAI
  - Queried the DB using `query_embeddings` instead of `query_texts`
  - Displayed matched document + distance + metadata

**Concepts learned:**

- External embedding vs internal embedding
- Why embedding dimensions must match
- Adding metadata to vector records
- Improved search quality using OpenAI LLM-powered embeddings

---

## 🧠 Next Steps (Ideas)

- Chunking larger documents and inserting them
- Ranking results based on metadata filters
- Adding response generation using OpenAI completions
- Exporting and importing vector data (e.g., `.json`, `.txt`, `.csv`)
- Building a simple Streamlit or Flask UI

---

# Lecture 14. Agentic systems

- Can hallucinate (make up information)
- Can make inappropriate decisions based on incorrect context
- When using agent systems, people don't improve or don't see the need to improve
- There can be security vulnerabilities due to the LLMs themselves (API keys, secret tokens, etc.)
- More expensive than chatting with LLM
- More expensive in terms of resources
- Agent systems don't follow project requirements. They need to be described separately.

These points outline various limitations and concerns about using AI agent systems, including issues with reliability, cost, security, and project management considerations.

# Lecture 16. Agent with email sending capabilities

- we will design the system.
  - web search on a person data.
  - people's b-day dates in a file
  - b-day greetings
  - (task scheduler, startup apps, python libraries that work in the background for checking).
  - Confirmations before sending
- we will choose the model for this.
- check out how to send emails via python.
- integrating chatbot with email sending capabilities.
